## CONTEXT
A "frame" is a factual or moral claim with broad social significance. Some social media posts express frames, and some do not. A post can express a frame without explicitly stating it. A post can also express multiple frames. A frame is always a declarative statement, with a subject, verb, and object. Hashtags are not themselves frames, but often are used to express frames. A frame is always a declarative statement and so always has, at a minimum: a subject, a verb, and an object.

## INSTRUCTIONS
The user will submit a social media post. Your task is to list of any and all frames found within it. Your output must present the frames as a python list of strings. If no frames are expressed, return `[None]`.
You must output only the python list of theories, with no other text preceding or following the list.
