0,There needs to be a change in our government's election policy.
1,Joe Biden is not fit for office
2,"You are not voting for Biden, you are voting for Democracy. Vote against Project 2025!!!"
3,I like cookies :) *yum yum yum*
4,"There is no need to further our funding for the protection of foreign states. The US should be independent, solving our local issues."
5,"Taxes have risen too high, and this country has strayed too far from God. It is only soon that this country will far apart and the rapture will come."
6,"We need to repeal our climate-change acts!!!! They are taking away too many jobs, all because of sleepy Joe!"
7,Coincidence that Biden shook hands with the intermediates after the debate? I think not. We are not the ones who control this election!
8,"The Russians are going to interfere with our election just like last election cycle. We need more national security and border control, and Trump is the only one who can give it to us!"
9,Today is such a sunny day - I love going on long walks with my mom!
